Basic configurations to my system, free to use

#-=-=- HOW TO USE -=-=-

Put the `config` file in $HOME/.config/i3/
Put the `start.py` file in $HOME/.config/

Make a new directory called `bg` in $HOME/.config/

Put any backgrounds you want to have when you restart
your computer in that folder

Rename them to bg{num}, Example: bg1.jpg, bg2.png, bg3.jpg and so on

!! FOR NOW IT ONLY WORKS WITH jpg AND png !!

These are my local scripts, they may not recieve many updates since
they are so small. Please fork them with your liking
