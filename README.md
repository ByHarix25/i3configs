Basic configurations to my system, free to use

-=-=- HOW TO USE -=-=-

-- config for i3

Put the `config` file in $HOME/.config/i3/


-- startup script

Put it in any folder

Make a new directory called `bg` in the same folder the script is in

Put any backgrounds you want to have in the folder

Rename the backgrounds to `bg(number)` Example: bg1.jpg, bg2.png, etc

!! FOR NOW IT ONLY WORKS WITH jpg AND png !!

-- .xmobarrc

Paste the file in your $HOME directory (~)

Install xmobar from your package manager


These are my local scripts, they may not recieve many updates since
they are so small. Please fork them with your liking
